I would like to think I've learned a lot from this project

I just can never find motivation to fix the bugs I introduced at the end

To fix it would require rebuilding from the ground up

Seperating the code into modules and setting up tests.

The web has grown a lot since then (build tools, package managers, mvc frameworks)

This project was meant as a native web replacement for flash that teachers can use to build interactive lessons

Maybe one day I'll reopen it.


# Install

the project is completely a client side application except for the download svg feature

Just run by opening index.html

the project uses the observer pattern as a means of seperating modules into components

you will find small demos of each component in the components directory

you can try drawing a square and animating it's x axis by clicking on the dimoned icon next to the x, moving the time line forward then moving the square

most of the bugs are the result of the freetransform tool as well as the groups feature which was a Raphael workaround.

it's possible to revert but at the time of development I didn't follow a good SVN workfllow so it's somewhat unpridictable.
